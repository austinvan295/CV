  <p>Howdy! My name is <strong>Austin Nguyen</strong> and I am a student at Texas Tech majoring in <strong>MIS</strong> with a concentration in <strong>application development</strong>. A little bit about me, I was born and raised in Montgomery,
    Texas until 2011 when I moved to Conroe, Texas. I graduated Conroe High School in 2017 and decided to put college on hold. After working at various odd jobs I decided to fully commit to college in 2019. I graduated with my associates at Lone Star
    In
    December of 2020. After switching majors plenty of times I finally found my passion which was MIS which is a balance of business and technology. I am very passionate about the tech industry because growing up I did a lot of HTML and CSS work for
    my
    gaming servers that I owned and didn't even know it. I also have plenty of side projects on my resume to show that I am eagered to learn new skills and concepts. After I graduate I plan on working in the tech industry and pursuing a role either
    in IT Consulting,
    Business Analyst, Information Security, Software Developer, or any tech related roles. I plan on pursuing an <strong>MBA</strong> later on in my career to obtain a leadership position.</p>
